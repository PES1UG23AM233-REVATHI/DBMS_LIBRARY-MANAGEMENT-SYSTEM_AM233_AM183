To replace the homepage banner with your image:

1. Save your image file as `home_banner.jpg` (or `home_banner.png`) and place it in this folder:
   static/img/home_banner.jpg

2. Recommended size: width >= 1200px, aspect ratio around 3:1 or 4:1. The template will scale it with `object-fit: cover`.

3. If `home_banner.jpg` is not present the site will fall back to `banner.svg` (already included).

If you want me to embed the attached image for you, tell me and I will attempt to save it as `static/img/home_banner.jpg` (if the platform supports uploading attachments into the repo).
